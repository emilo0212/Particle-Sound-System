# Particle-Sound-System (PSS)
PSS is a system originally created based on the idea of having particles to react to a combination of the frequency and volume of sound waves. It was later doing the development of the project that the idea was modified to exclude the sound part of the project as that no longer was in interest, yet the part with the sound was left in the project as a memory of the original idea. The current end result of the project should be considered a basic particle system with modifiable factors in a user-friendly interface based off of [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). 

### Demonstration
The project can be downloaded and tested by downloading the Demo folder and starting the exe file.

### References

PSS uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) - Mainly for the sound control.
* [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) - User-Interface.
* [SDL](https://www.sdl.com/) - Creating the window.
